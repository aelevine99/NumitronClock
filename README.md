# NumitronClock

## Project Overview
This project uses soviet IV-12 tubes (they were easier to find than actual Numitrons) for a fun, retro-inspired desk clock. The primary component of this design is a control board that will drive 2 tubes at a time. I will update this description and provide documentation as the project evolves.
