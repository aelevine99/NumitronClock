# NumitronClock

## Project Overview
This project uses soviet IV-12 tubes (they were easier to find than actual Numitrons) for a fun, retro-inspired desk clock. The project is split into two main parts for modularity: a breakout board that can drive 2 tubes, and a control board with 2 outputs for breakout boards. I will update this description and provide documentation as the project evolves.
