"Advert for RCA NUMITRON Display Devices". Electronic Design. 22 (12). Hayden: 163. 1974-06-07.

This project uses soviet IV-12 tubes (they were easier to find than actual Numitrons) for a fun, retro-inspired desk clock. I've split the project into modules so that I can :
1. Breakout board for 2 tubes.
2. Clock board with RTC and GPS for automatic time updates.
3. 'Mother' board that will host a removable controller and dock all other modules, similar in style to an Arduino shield or Pi HAT.
